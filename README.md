# CV_Leaf_segmentation_algorithm
Write a function that segments a leaf image, and returns a binary (dtype='bool') image representing the segmentation. Your algorithm must be based on thresholding and you should consider doing some region processing after segmentation to improve the result.

Hint: You'll need to be a bit creative when devising your solution -- no single technique from class is likely to give you a particularly good solution, and you may need to think of some tricks that were not explicitly covered in class. However, you can get a good result with a fairly simple algorithm. You'll also need to decide how to handle the fact that the input images are colour, although this shouldn't pose too much of a problem, in fact, it is an advantage!
